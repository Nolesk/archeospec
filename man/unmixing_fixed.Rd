\title{Fix the endmembers}
\usage{
unmixing_fixed(signatures, endmember_files, endmember_names = NULL,
  endmember_colors = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{signatures}{A spectral object built using the load_signature_files function.}

\item{endmember_files}{A vector of filenames (strings) of the selected signatures to be fixed as endmembers.}

\item{endmember_names}{A vector of names to be assigned to each selected endmember. Optional, by default (NONE) uses the filenames.}

\item{endmember_colors}{A vector of color names to be assigned to each selected endmember. Check for possible colors \code{\link{colors}}.
Optional, by default (NONE) use random colors.}
}
\value{
A data frame which contains the files which match with the selected endmembers.
}
\description{
Find the files which match with the computed endmembers.
